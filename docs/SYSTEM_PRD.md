### 9. Internationalization (i18n) and Multi-language Support

#### Requirements
- Runtime language switching via a language selector; selection is persisted between sessions
- Admin can manage available languages (add, publish/unpublish, delete, set default)
- Default language fallback for UI and content
- Right-to-left (RTL) support where applicable
- Multi-language content fields across the system:
  - Site configuration titles and descriptions
  - Album titles and descriptions
  - Photo titles and descriptions
- Translation bundles stored per language
- Language bundles are loaded on demand; UI text updates without page reload
- HTML language and direction attributes set dynamically for SEO and accessibility

#### User Stories
- As a viewer, I can switch the site language so I can browse in my preferred language
- As an admin, I can enable/disable languages and set a default so I control what visitors see
- As a content editor, I can enter titles/descriptions per language so albums and photos are localized

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Changing language updates all UI strings and localized content immediately and persists after refresh
- Only published languages appear in the selector; default language is applied when a chosen language is unavailable
- RTL languages switch layout direction and styling; components render correctly in RTL
- Multi-language field fallback order: current language → English → any available language → provided fallback
- Deleting English is blocked; deleting the default language reassigns a new default automatically

#### Admin Flows
- Manage languages in the dashboard:
  - Add language with code, name, native name, published status
  - Publish/unpublish and set default
  - Delete non-English languages
  - Drag to enable/disable lists and choose default

#### Data Model
- Languages: array of language objects with code, name, native name, published status, and default flag
- Default language: string identifier
- Localized fields stored as key-value pairs by language code

#### Frontend Behavior
- Language provider with on-demand bundle loading; ensures selected language bundle is available before switching
- Language selector reads available languages from configuration, ensures bundles are available, and updates document attributes
- RTL provider applies appropriate layout direction and styling for RTL languages

#### Templates
- Templates must use helpers to read multi-language fields (e.g., album/photo titles) with fallback logic
- Translations for template UI strings should be stored in language-specific translation files
