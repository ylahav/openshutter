#### Frontend Behavior
- Language provider with on-demand bundle loading; ensures selected language bundle is available before switching
- Language selector reads available languages from configuration, ensures bundles are available, and updates document attributes
- RTL provider applies appropriate layout direction and styling for RTL languages

#### Templates
- Templates must use helpers to read multi-language fields (e.g., album/photo titles) with fallback logic
- Translations for template UI strings should be stored in language-specific translation files
