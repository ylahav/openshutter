  name: string,
  alias: string,
  description?: string,
  isPublic: boolean,
  isFeatured: boolean,
  createdBy: string // Set automatically
}

// Update album (only if owner)
PUT /api/albums/[id]
{
  name: string,
  alias: string,
  description?: string,
  isPublic: boolean,
  isFeatured: boolean
}

// Delete album (only if owner)
DELETE /api/albums/[id]
```

### Profile Operations
```typescript
// Get profile
GET /api/auth/profile
// Returns: { user: { _id, name, email, role, createdAt, updatedAt } }

// Update profile
PUT /api/auth/profile
{
  name: string,
  email: string,
  currentPassword?: string, // Required if changing password
  newPassword?: string      // Required if changing password
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

## Internationalization

### Supported Languages
- English (default)
- Hebrew (RTL support)

### Translation Keys
All UI text uses translation keys from `src/i18n/en.json`:

### RTL Support
- Automatic layout direction switching
- RTL-specific styling
- Proper text alignment and icon positioning

## Performance Considerations

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for album cards
- Progress indicators for form submissions
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

### Data Fetching
- Efficient API calls
- Proper error handling
- Loading state management
- Caching where appropriate

### Image Optimization
- Thumbnail generation for album covers
- Lazy loading for large image sets
- Responsive image sizing

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- API integration tests
- Access control tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end user flows
