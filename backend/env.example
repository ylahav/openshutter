# Backend Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your production values

# MongoDB Configuration
# For MongoDB with authentication (recommended for production):
# IMPORTANT: If your password contains special characters (!, @, #, $, %, &, etc.), 
# you MUST URL-encode them in the connection string:
#   ! = %21, @ = %40, # = %23, $ = %24, % = %25, & = %26
# Example: If password is "mypass!123", use "mypass%21123"
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@your-mongodb-host:27017/openshutter?authSource=admin
# For MongoDB without authentication:
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The database name is specified in the URI path (after the port)
# Format: mongodb://host:port/DATABASE_NAME
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/openshutter

# Note: MONGODB_DB is NOT used by the application - the database name is in MONGODB_URI
# MONGODB_DB=openshutter  # This is for reference only, not used by code

# Authentication Configuration
AUTH_JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-production-secret-key-here

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
