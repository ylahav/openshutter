    # Option 1: Use host networking (recommended for external MongoDB)
    network_mode: host
    # Option 2: Use bridge network with extra_hosts (uncomment if host networking doesn't work)
    # networks:
    #   - openshutter-network

    #   - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

# Uncomment if using bridge networking instead of host networking
